# Ecosystem Simulator
This is a ~~game~~ simulation made using Greenfoot for ICS4U, developed by the following people:
* Freeman Wang (TileMap system, Pathfinding & Story)
* Tony Lin (Animation & art)
* Osmond Lin (Animal behaviours)
* Ivan Xie (Music & sound)
* Neelan Thurairajah (UI and settings)

In this game, you play as a person who is temporarily filling in for God and is tasked to create a thriving and sustainable ecosystem for a specified duration of time.

This game is completed in the sense that it will not get any more updates. Not like I want to wade through the mess that we've made once more.

## Getting the Game
To play this, you would need to [install Greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org/download) through the given link. It doesn't matter how you installed it, as long as it's there.\
You know, the standard procedure like any other software.

Next, you have to clone this repo (or get its source code).

I guess you can go to your terminal, navigate somewhere where you want to clone to, and run
```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/kingmclol/EcosystemSimulator.git
```
and probably, it would work. If I didn't make a typo there.

Or, you can use the green button that says `<>Code` at the top-right and just take a zip file of the code and extract it somewhere.

Anyway, once you've got the code, you can run Greenfoot and open the EcosystemSimulator folder from there, and you should be able to play now.

## Credits
This game uses some borrowed assets. Obviously, we didn't make *everything,* otherwise we'd never finish on time.\
Hopefully we didn't violate anything important or anything...
